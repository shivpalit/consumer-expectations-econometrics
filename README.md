# Consumer Expectations Econometrics Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, developed as the final project for the Econometrics course in the Economics major at Davidson College, analyzes consumer expectations and their economic implications using econometric methods. Using consumer survey data from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (2011-2019), the study examines how personal and non-personal variables affect consumers' expectations for future economic performance.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed that both personal and non-personal variables have statistically significant explanatory power for consumer economic expectations. Notably, expectation of personal finances for the following year showed the strongest influence among personal variables. Additionally, the research found that the marginal influences of some variables fluctuate based on whether the S&P500 index price change is positive or negative.
